      <p class="1">A Grocery Store Garlic Obsession</p>
      <p class="2">At first you might think that Professor Patterson was kidding.A little conmmentary about garlic mentioned here. A little anecdote in passing there. Upon refelection, however, it would become clear that the mentiones belied a deep set obsession with the odiforous bulb. Making many question whether there was vampire trauma in his past.</p>
